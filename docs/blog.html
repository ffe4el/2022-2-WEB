<h4 align="center">ðŸŒ± My major is Digital Agriculture Tech. I study Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.<br>
Currently, I am studying about the front-end, reading a book, watching related YouTube, and studying on my own.<br>
These days, I most focused on plant smart-farm environmental control using Arduino and raspberry pie.
<br>âš¡ Fun fact: I've gained weight lately, so I'm doing free weight training.</h4>
